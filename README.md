Hi all, i am an aspiring developer who just graduated from a boot camp. 

I did a mock airbnb on my own and implemented the following:
1) Bookings with new bookings, approvals, rejects and cancellation. 
2) Notification feature
3) Listings (CRUD)
4) Redemption using an 'airbnb points' system
5) API calls using mapbox to show map
6) Favorites feature
7) Resolve all N+1 queries

What i did not do but hope to do:
1) Reviews

Its not fantastic, but i learnt a lot from this mock website buildup. Let me know what you think!
