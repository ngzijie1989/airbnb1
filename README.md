Hi all, i am an aspiring developer who just graduated from a boot camp. Please checkout my demo website!
I did a mock airbnb on my own and implemented the following:
1) Bookings with new bookings, approvals, rejects and cancellation. 
2) Notifications
3) Listings
4) Redemption using a points system
5) API calls using mapbox to show map

What i did not do but hope to do:
1) Reviews
